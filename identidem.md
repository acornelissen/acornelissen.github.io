**Having a little company was a good experience for the year it lasted, but my volume of sales hasn't really warranted the effort and cost behind running a busines in my free time. So I've wound down the company.**

### This means:

- I'll keep making stuff, and releasing them under the IDENTIDEM.design brand for free on printables.com
- If you want your Polaroid 110A/110B/800 converted to shoot Instax Wide, I still do that - shoot me a message on Instagram and we can talk specifics
- See one of my designs you like, but don't want to build it yourself? Get in touch as I might consider selling a complete build depending on how busy I am, and whether the price is right
- I also do custom design work for camera-related stuff (both analogue and digital) - once again, get in touch on Instagram if you need help
